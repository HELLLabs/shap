# s'hap - a home automation project that really saves energy!

### the problem.
Mega watts and Giga watts of power/energy is being wasted, majorly in the transmission and distribution process, due to electricity theft, ancient technology usage, unavailability of funds, expensive energy saving appliances and due to the carelessness of citizens.

### existing solutions.
- Appliances available with star ratings
- Fake, expensive energy saving devices available in market
- Installation of electric meters outside house to avoid tampering - LEDs used instead of conventional light sources
- Solar panels used and motivated etc.

**But these do not work in commercial environment, primarily because they’re meant for self consumption or the regular home usage.**

So, with a motto of **do one thing and do it best**, we've created our project's very first avatar for use in hostels/commercial buildings!
